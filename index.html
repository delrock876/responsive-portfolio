        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>My name is Sabrina and I'm on my way to becoming a fullstack developer! I grew up in Hawthorne, California where I
        reside to this day. Growing up
        I loved to draw and play video games. It was a form of expression for me as I didn't have much control in other aspects
        of my life. I went to a private school
        all of elementary and then spent four years in an even stricter high school: Hawthorne Math and Science Academy (yes,
        it's as terrible as it sounds).
        However, while attenting I was introduced to programming via Scratch. I had so much fun playing around on Scratch; it
        was another avenue for self expression, but it wasn't
        until college that I seriously considered programming as a career. On a whim, I took C and Swift classes at my local
        community college. I had the same professor for both
        classes and even though I struggled a lot, I can honestly say my professor for those classes encouraged me and helped me
        succeed. I learned to enjoy programming in those
        classes, however basic they may have been. Now, I look forward to diving deeper and expanding my knowledge to the best
        of my ability.
